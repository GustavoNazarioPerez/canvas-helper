# Practice

These are some practice problems that we are going to work on.

## Set 1
The purpose of this first set is to get some practice writing basic Python functions while reinforcing best practices. We will get experience with `flake8`, `mypy`, and `git`. 

> üí° **Note:** AI would probably solve this in an instant ‚Äî please **don‚Äôt use it**. The goal is not to be correct right away but to **learn** by practicing.

### Git Setup
1. Make sure you are in the `canvas-helper/` directory.

2. Create a branch off of this one to work on

<summary>Click to reveal the solution</summary>

```bash
git pull
git switch gustavo/practice-problems
git switch -c angel/practice-problems
```
</details>

### Prerequisites
I am assuming that you are using `wsl` here.

1. Run `python3 --version`, ensure that it is installed. Otherwise run the following:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

2. After installing `python3`, create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# You can run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment
```

3. Once you are in your virtual environment, run the following to install `mypy` and `flake8`
```bash
pip install mypy flake8
```

4. Verify
```bash
mypy --version
flake8 --version
```

### The Problem Set
Take a look at `pycanvas/practice/set1/set1.py`.

We are writing three functions here. The goal is to pass all checks (like flake8 and mypy) when you make a pull request. These will show up as ‚úÖ checkmarks in the GitHub UI once your code is clean.

Don't feel like you need to wait until the very end to make a pull request.

```python
def is_even(n: int) -> bool:
```
- This function is going to take in an integer and return true if it is even, false otherwise.
- Look into the [modulo](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/what-is-a-modulo-operator-in-python/) operator
- Notice the `(n: int)` and `-> bool` here. This is telling `mypy` that we expect `n` to be an integer and the return of the function to be a boolean (`True` or `False`).

```python
def average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
```
- This function is going to take a list of numbers (may be decimals) and return the average of them.
- Notice the `(numbers: list[float])` and `-> float` here. This is telling `mypy` that we expect `numbers` to be a list of float and the return of the function to be a float representing the average.

```python
def is_positive(n: int) -> bool:
```
- This function is going to take in an integer and return true if it is positive, false if it is negative.
- Start with whatever solution you can think of, try to make it a one liner if possible.

### Testing
There are some tests in the `tests/` directory but feel free to write your own manual tests in the file.

> If **any one** of the CI fails, the PR will show ‚ùå. Check the **"Actions" tab** to see exactly which part failed and what the error message was.

```python
print(is_even(4))      # Expected: True
print(average([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))  # Expected: 2.0
print(is_positive(-1)) # Expected: False
```

Running tests locally (not CI)
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Running flake locally
```bash
flake8 pycanvas tests
```

Running mypy locally
```bash
mypy pycanvas
```
