# Practice

These are some practice problems that we are going to work on.

## Set 1
The purpose of this first set is to get some practice writing basic Python functions while reinforcing best practices. We will get experience with `flake8`, `mypy`, and `git`. 

> üí° **Note:** AI would probably solve this in an instant ‚Äî please **don‚Äôt use it**. The goal is not to be correct right away but to **learn** by practicing.

### Git Setup
1. Make sure you are in the `canvas-helper/` directory.

2. Create a branch off of this one to work on

```bash
git pull
git switch gustavo/practice-problems
git switch -c angel/practice-problems
```
</details>

### Prerequisites
I am assuming that you are using `wsl` here.

1. Run `python3 --version`, ensure that it is installed. Otherwise run the following:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

2. After installing `python3`, create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# You can run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment
```

3. Once you are in your virtual environment, run the following to install `mypy` and `flake8`
```bash
pip install mypy flake8
```

4. Verify
```bash
mypy --version
flake8 --version
```

### The Problem Set
Take a look at `pycanvas/practice/set1/set1.py`.

We are writing three functions here. The goal is to pass all checks (like flake8 and mypy) when you make a pull request. These will show up as ‚úÖ checkmarks in the GitHub UI once your code is clean.

Don't feel like you need to wait until the very end to make a pull request.

```python
def is_even(n: int) -> bool:
```
- This function is going to take in an integer and return true if it is even, false otherwise.
- Look into the [modulo](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/what-is-a-modulo-operator-in-python/) operator
- Notice the `(n: int)` and `-> bool` here. This is telling `mypy` that we expect `n` to be an integer and the return of the function to be a boolean (`True` or `False`).

```python
def average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
```
- This function is going to take a list of numbers (may be decimals) and return the average of them.
- Notice the `(numbers: list[float])` and `-> float` here. This is telling `mypy` that we expect `numbers` to be a list of float and the return of the function to be a float representing the average.

```python
def is_positive(n: int) -> bool:
```
- This function is going to take in an integer and return true if it is positive, false if it is negative.
- Start with whatever solution you can think of, try to make it a one liner if possible.

### Testing
There are some tests in the `tests/` directory but feel free to write your own manual tests in the file.

> If **any one** of the CI fails, the PR will show ‚ùå. Check the **"Actions" tab** to see exactly which part failed and what the error message was.

```python
print(is_even(4))      # Expected: True
print(average([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))  # Expected: 2.0
print(is_positive(-1)) # Expected: False
```

Running tests locally (not CI)
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Running flake locally
```bash
flake8 pycanvas tests
```

Running mypy locally
```bash
mypy pycanvas
```

## Set 2
After Set 2 you will be able to say you worked with:
- Handling user input
- Object Oriented Programming
- Python imports

### Git Setup
1. Make sure you are in the `canvas-helper/` directory.

2. Create a branch off of `main`

git switch main

### Prerequisites
Same as set 1

### The Problem Set
Take a look at `pycanvas/practice/set2/utils/canvas_functions.py`.

We are now working with a class and some functions that operate on objects of that class.

#### The `Assignment` Class

```python
class Assignment:
    def __init__(self, course: str, name: str, assignment_type: str, due_date: str):
```
This class represents an assignment in Canvas, like a quiz, homework, or exam.

Each assignment has four attributes:

`course`: the name of the course (e.g., "Physics II")

`name`: the name of the assignment (e.g., "Newton's Laws")

`assignment_type`: the type of assignment (e.g., "Quiz")

`due_date`: a string representing the due date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-12-22")

When printed, the assignment object will show a string like:

```bash
Physics II - Newton's Laws (Quiz) due 2025-12-22
```

#### The Functions
```python
def filter_by_class(assignments: list[Assignment], course_name: str) -> list[Assignment] | None:
```
This function filters a list of assignments by course name.

It should return a list of only those assignments that match the given course.

Example:

```python
filter_by_class(assignments, "Math")
```
should return only the Math assignments.

If no assignments match, return an empty list, not None.

```python
def sort_assignments(assignments: list[Assignment], order: str = "asc") -> list[Assignment] | None:
```
This function sorts a list of assignments by due date.

The order parameter determines the sorting order:

"asc" ‚Üí earliest due dates first

"desc" ‚Üí latest due dates first

Use the due_date string (in "YYYY-MM-DD" format) for sorting.

You may find the datetime module useful for this.

Return the sorted list. If the list is empty, return an empty list.

##### Utility Function
```python
def display_assignments(assignments: list[Assignment]):
```
This function prints each assignment in the list, using the __repr__ method defined in the class.

You can use it for testing and debugging to easily see what's in your list.

#### Main
- The main entrypoint of this code is in `pycanvas/practice/set2/set2.py` 
- This uses imports to get the functions from above available for use. Right now
the imports are broken so those will have to be fixed.
- The goal for main is to get some user input that will be passed into our util functions.
- I would suggest starting with main, as in, getting the user input first and then writing 
the util functions.
